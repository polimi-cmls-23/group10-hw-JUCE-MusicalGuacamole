Monique is a monophonic synthesizer plugin made in the JUCE platform. It implements subtractive synthesis with a unique signal path to create an interesting take on a classic design. Another unique feature is the “Morph Mixer” that allows a user to blend between preset settings for the oscillators, filters, arpeggiators and effects.
