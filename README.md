# Monique Monophonic Synthesizer

Monique is a monophonic synthesizer plugin made in the JUCE platform. It implements subtractive synthesis with a unique signal path to create an interesting take on a classic design. One unique feature is the “Morph Mixer” that allows a user to blend between preset settings for the oscillators, filters, arpeggiators and effects.

This repository contains a report analysising this plugin as well as a high level presentation and demonstration video of the software synth.
